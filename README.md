# Description

A python package for implementing some of the basic IRL worlds like GridWorld (Abbeel & Ng 2004), ObjectWorld (Levine et. al. 2011) and BinaryWorld (Wulfmeier et. al. 2015).

## Possible structure

1. Generic IRL world class that each world has to extend
2. Generic reward function class that each world has to derive
3. (Maybe?) Generic feature vector and transition matrix classes
